# 8-Bit-CPU-EERPOM-Programmer
This is an Arduino code to program EEPROMs for a breadboard 8-Bit CPU based on Ben Eater CPU desgin (microcode instructions programmer)

Features include:
* Reduced components in compare with Ben Eater's design
* 256 bit of SRAM instead of 64
* 4 CPU cycles per micro-instruction instead of 6
* Different ram buses for instructions and data


To program the EEPROM, you will need the following:
* An Arduino compatible board
* 2 shift registers (e.g. 74hc595)
* Of course, the EEPROM chips
